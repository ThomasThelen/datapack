\title{DataObject is a wrapper for raw data to include important system-level metadata about the object.}
\description{
DataObject is a wrapper class that associates raw data with system-level metadata
describing the object.  The system metadata includes attributes such as the object's identifier,
type, size, checksum, owner, version relationship to other objects, access rules, and other critical metadata.
The SystemMetadata is compliant with the DataONE federated repository network's definition of SystemMetadata, and
is encapsulated as a separate object that can be manipulated as needed. Additional science-level and
domain-specific metadata is out-of-scope for SystemMetadata, which is intended only for critical metadata for
managing objects in a repository system.
}
\details{
A DataObject can be constructed by passing the data and SystemMetadata to the new() method, or by passing
an identifier, data, format, user, and DataONE node identifier, in which case a SystemMetadata instance will
be generated with these fields and others that are calculated (such as size and checksum).

An obvious limitation of the current implementation is that all data are stored in memory, which limits
the effective size of objects.  It would be useful to add a data cache that stores larger objects on the file
system.
