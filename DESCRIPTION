Title: datapackage: A flexible container to transport and manipulate data and associated resources
Version: 0.1
Authors@R: "Matthew Jones <jones@nceas.ucsb.edu> [aut, cre]"
Description: The datapackage provides a flexible container to transport and manipulate complex sets of data 
    that consist of multiple data files and associated metadata and ancillary files.  The files are linked 
    together using the OAI-ORE standard resource map, which describes the relationships between the files. 
    Data packages can be serialized and transported as structured zip files following the BagIt specification.
