Description: The datapackage provides a flexible container to transport and
    manipulate complex sets of data that consist of multiple data files and
    associated metadata and ancillary files.  Individual data objects have
    associated system level metadata, and data files are linked together using
    the OAI-ORE standard resource map, which describes the relationships
    between the files. Data packages can be serialized and transported as
    structured zip files following the BagIt specification.
